# 🖥️ A website made specifically for my AP CSP class
There's not much else to it; just a place to store my projects until they inevitably get wiped from Code.org's database.
## 📝 Credit where credit is due
The CSS **background** for my website was derived from and originally created by Osorina Irina. I acquired the source code from [this Codepen](https://codepen.io/osorina/pen/PQdMOO). I do not claim this work as my own.
